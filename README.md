# Restaurant-page
This is part of the Odin Project's Javascript Curriculum: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/restaurant-page

This project is a basic restaurant landing page built with html, css and Javascript. The objective of this project was to learn the basics of webpack and npm. Additionally I made the site responsive.
